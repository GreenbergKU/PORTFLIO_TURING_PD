Ideas here are adapted from [Atomic Habits by James Clear](https://bookshop.org/books/atomic-habits-an-easy-proven-way-to-build-good-habits-break-bad-ones/9780735211292)

**Habits of a Software Developer**
* What do you think are the traits of a good software developer? 
    - What are they like in the workplace? 
    - What would you as a co-worker think of this person?
        - communication, hard worker, reliable, routine, organization, consistance
        - i would be impressed and i would want to work with them
    - What are the habits that this person demonstrates to embody the identity of a software developer?

* Who do you want to be as a software developer? 
    - What kind of behaviors do you already have in place to be that person? 
    - What behaviors would you need to put into place? 
    - How will you do that?

**Working on the 1st Law of Behavior Change: Make it Obvious**
* Bring self-awareness to your current habits by making a Habits Scorecard.
    - Make a list of your daily habits (examples: wake up, turn off alarm, check phone, etc.) as a way to bring awareness to what you do. 
    - Then, decide how effective that habit is for you and your goal of becoming a software developer. 
        - Put a + next to habits that are effective; 
        - put a - next to habits that are not effective; 
        - put a = next to habits that are neutral. 

```  **ignore first two alarms** and wake-up at 8:30am, go pee, let dog out, make coffee, feed dog, make breakfast, eat,  dress, brush hair, smoke cig, refill water bottle, refill coffee, go into office, turn on comp, check #2005 slack, check #2003 repeaters channel, check calender, turn on monitor, airplay, adjust windows, open daily lesson, open slack call ```
* Pick 1 new habit you'd like to build and create an implementation intention following this template: "I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION]." 
     **[CURRENT_HABBIT]**:
    **ignore first two alarms**
    **[NEW_HABBIT]**:
    **"I will [WAKE-UP] at [8] in [THE_MORNING]."**
    
    - Then, stack the habit onto something you already do:
        - (Hint: make this highly specific and immediately actionable) 
        ```    "After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT]."   ```
    
    **"After [CURRENT_HABIT], I will [NEW_HABIT]."***  
    
* Design your environment for success: 
    - What changes could you make in your space to better implement your habit? 
    - How could you remove any triggers for bad habits? 
    - How will you implement these changes? 

* Respond after a few days of this implementation: 
    - What are your results? How do you feel about this method? 
    - How will you move forward with this habit?
