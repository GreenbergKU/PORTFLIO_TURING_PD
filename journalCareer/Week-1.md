# Mod 1 Week 1: Understanding your strengths

## Describe one of your strengths
### What is something you have learned to do well (list a skill)? <br>

- I am good at looking at things from outside the box and finding creative ways to reach my goal.  
- I am learning my way around git and github well too.

### What is something you know about (list some knowledge/expertise you have)? <br>

- I am good at conversation, 'small talk', I can keep a conversation going to make the other person feel more comforting and willing to open up.

### What is something you have a natural ability to do well (list a talent)? <br>

- I am a good tennis player.  I don't know if that's natural but I played all my life.

### How do those combine to create a specific strength? <br>

- I have a very competitive nature and tennis behind an individual super, I never have up, and always relief on myself to win.  However, my ability to connect with others can help me build the spirit and convince others they can do it too.

### In your own words, what do these top 4 qualities tell you about yourself? <br>

- Intuitive-Conceputal: I can think outside of the box and make associations to larger concepts from smaller, more fundamental concepts I'm familiar with. <br>

- Transformer: I like adventure and excitement.  Change and challenges are sought after and not avoided. <br>

- Inspirational Leader: I have the ability and patience to understand and relate to each individual.  I can use that to bring people together, and access emotions that will envoke enthusiasm. <br>

- Lover of Wisdom: I see the world from many different vantage points.  I can apply the things I do know to unfamiliar situations and come up with realistic solutions. <br>

### Do they resonate with you? Why/why not? <br>

- kind of, I just feel like this website is so optimistic it seems irrational.  Without stateing the downfalls of each category seems like it takes away from the value of the traits it does report.

### How do they relate to the strength you wrote about in Prompt #1? <br>

- The ispirational leader seems to relate to how I described my strenths.  


## Challenges with strengths
### What can make it challenging to recognize your strengths? How can you work through those challenges? <br>

- Sometimes I get so caught up in what my weaknesses are, I overlook, or take for granted the strengths.

### Do you ever see yourself overusing certain strengths? In what circumstances would you want to use them less and amplify other strengths? How could you adjust your approach in those instances <br>

- I think I overuse the ability to see things from many different points of view because I put so much effort into trying to decide what somebody wants, or how I think they want me to think, that I forget to use my gut, and go with what I think.

## Strengths in action
### Write 1-2 sentences describing how you like to work (i.e., Do you pre-plan? Do you talk through your ideas first? Do you work better with deadlines? How do you stay organized?) <br>

- I like to create logical map in my head of what i intend to do.  I try to do 1 step at a time, and use console.log('EVERYTHING') to make sure what I intend to do matches with what I am actually writing in my code.  If the code is not behaving the way i intended, or if i get really confused, I try to stop, and write out what I want to do (in the form of comments on the file i'm writing my code).  If I think I might need documentation to help me write my code, i like to pull that up and skim over it before I begin to write my code.

- In terms of class notes, I like to rewrite my notes using a color coding technique and especially when syntax is concerned, I like to break it down, understand why the code is structed in the way that it is and visualize where they are accessing different types of data and how they are conveying that in code I am unfamiliar with.

### How could you talk about these working preferences with your project teammates? Your mentor? Your instructors? <br>

-  I think it would be helpful if people left the console.logs an comments in thier ammended code (commented out) to show others that they have been checking to make sure everything is running the way they intended.  It saves time and energy because if I see console.logs, I am less likely to think that that code is throwing errors becuase it was checked throughout the creation process.
-  Pull Request Templates help to organize changes, and slows down the process, which hopefully lessens the chances for merge conflicts or git related issues.

### What would you need to be aware of when working with people who have different strengths from you? <br>

- Awareness that everyone is different, and that what one person sees as a weakness, another might see as a strength.  
- There are many ways to accomplish the same goal, and there is usually no 'RIGHT' way.  
- Give others the oportunity to explain how and why they wrote their code the way they did, it might make more sense or use a method you did not consider.
- Be open, clear, and frequent with communication within the group.  Over stateing something is so much better than not stateing at all.  If you are clear about what you expect from others, and vice versa, it is easier for everyone to stay on task, and do what is asked/expected of them.

### How could your Pairin results help you better understand your everyday working preferences? <br>

- The customized Parin results can put into words what your strengths are so that you can verbalize them to others, and destiguish the differences so you know what exactly you should be working on, or know when/where you can offer your skill sets.  

## Continued growth
### Is there any particular strength you'd like to sharpen while you're at Turing? Any area you consider a weakness that you'd like to strengthen? <br>

- I would like to improve on my understanding of fundmentals and my ability to vocalize to others what my code is doing, or what it is that I intend for my code to do.

### What are some steps you could take here? <br>

- I can continue to expain my code to mentor even if I understand what I'm doing.  
- I can be available in our study hall room to answer question or work through issues with classmates
- Speak up when I don't fully understand something


### How could you be aware of progress you're making? <br>

- Scheduling sessions with John Adams twice a week to go over anything I want to.  Get individualized help, 1 on 1 mentoring on a very regular, scheduled routine.  Use him to judge my progress, and hold me accountable for my own learning.  
- This will help me be more confident of the material I am processing because last mod I was never sure if I was processing the information correctly and would find out later that how I was interpreting something was not compoletely accurate.
