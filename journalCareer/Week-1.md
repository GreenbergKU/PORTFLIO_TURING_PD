## Mod 1 Week 1: Understanding your strengths

## Describe one of your strengths
### What is something you have learned to do well (list a skill)?

- I am learning my way around git and github well too.
### What is something you know about (list some knowledge/expertise you have)?
- I am good at conversation, 'small talk', I can keep a conversation going to make the other person feel more comforting and willing to open up.
### What is something you have a natural ability to do well (list a talent)?
- I am a good tennis player.  I don't know if that's natural but I played all my life.
### How do those combine to create a specific strength?
- I have a very competitive nature and tennis behind an individual super, I never have up, and always relief on myself to win.  However, my ability to connect with others can help me build the spirit and convince others they can do it too.
