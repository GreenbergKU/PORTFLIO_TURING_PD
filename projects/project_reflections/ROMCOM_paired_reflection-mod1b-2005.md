# Project Reflection

<!-- Use this template to keep a log of reflections on each of your projects through Mod 1, 2, 3, and 4 at Turing. Feel free to add additional questions/prompts that you want to reflect on to help you prepare for future interviews.  -->

## Abstract

* Write clean, DRY JavaScript to store data
* Use a provided class by creating object instances using the `new` keyword
* Manipulate the page after it has loaded adding, removing, and updating elements on the DOM
* Understand event bubbling and use event delegation on dynamic elements
* Begin to understand how to write effective, clean HTML & CSS

<!-- In a few sentences, explain **what** the project was and the scope of your work. Imagine explaining your answer to a technical recruiter or a developer who you'd potentially be interviewing with. -->

## Overal (choose one)

What is your approach to working on a team? (In your answer, provide an example from this project)?

- I try and over communicate because I feel it is better to over explain myself than to leave things unsaid.

  - I know that I would much rather have more informaiton than I need and fully understand where my partners are coming from.
  - So important to know exactly what others expect from you, and vice-versa.  

<!-- 
- What role do you typically play on a team? (If you answer, provide an example from this project)
- Tell me about a time you had a disagreement with a colleague and how you resolved it. (only choose if applicable to this project) 
-->

## Technical (choose one)


What resources or strategies did you use when you were presented with a technical challenge?

- When I'm stuck I have a 'go-to' method.  I have been trying to incorporate more pseudo-coding into this methodology, 

  1. pseudo-code
  2. developer tools
  3. ask for help
  4. google search

<!-- - What was a specific technical challenge your group faced? How did you approach this challenge? What went well? What was a struggle?
- You canâ€™t work out how to solve a coding problem. What do you do to find the answer?
 -->

 ## Reflection


**What is one personal/professional takeaway from this project?**

- Sometimes you have to give and take.  
- There were things I really wanted to do, like split up our functions and combine some reoccurring patterns into functions of thier own, but my partner was not into it.  
- I just stopped focusing on that and put my energy elsewhere, cause in the end, as long as I am learning and building strong fundamentals, the details of one project are going to be less significant as time goes on. 

**What is one technical takeaway from this project?**

- I am developing and modifying my 'go-to' method when I find myself stuck and finding solutions in much quicker, more efficient way

**Based on these takeaways, what is something you want to focus on for the next project?**

- Developing code that is as dynamic as possible, with the knowlege and tools I currently possess.
