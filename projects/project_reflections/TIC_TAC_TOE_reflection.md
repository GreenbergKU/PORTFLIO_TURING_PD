# Project Reflections

## Abstract

- Create a TIC-TAC-TOE game using JavaScript/JSON, HTML, and CSS.  
- Data Model should update the DOM, not vice-versa.
- Application saves all winning games for a particular player in local storage. 
- A smaller replica of the players' past games (wins only) should appear in the form of the board game layout, on their half of the screen
- Application consisted of one HTML page or template, one external stylesheet, and three JavaScript files (player.js for Player class, game.js for Game class, and a main.js for all other JavaScipt code.)

## Overall 
- SOLO PROJECT so none of the questions in this section apply to this project

## Technical (Choose one)
- My biggest technical challege was that I had trouble conceputalizing the project, and therefore could not create a through plan of action.  I started off with a plan that was more than I was capable of creating, and ended up digging myself a huge hole.  I decided to start over on early Sat Morning, but that didn't leave me adequate time to create a product anywhere near the caliber I expect from myself.  

## Reflection
- If the guidelines or requirements are unclear, I should go to one of the instructors right away and get clarification.  I need to be able to understand what is being asked of me, so I can form a realistic and rational approach.  It helped me to talk to Casey during our project assessments, but that was on Monday, and they were due on Tuesday.  If I had done it sooner, I would have had the time to create an outcome i could be proud of, and it would have (hopefullly) displayed my abilities more accurately.
