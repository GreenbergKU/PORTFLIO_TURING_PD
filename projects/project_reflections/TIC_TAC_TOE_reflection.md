# Project Reflections

## Abstract

- Create a TIC-TAC-TOE game using JavaScript/JSON, HTML, and CSS.  
- Data Model should update the DOM, not vice-versa.
- Application saves all winning games for a particular player in local storage. 
- A smaller replica of the players' past games (wins only) should appear in the form of the board game layout, on their half of the screen
- Application consisted of one HTML page or template, one external stylesheet, and three JavaScript files (player.js for Player class, game.js for Game class, and a main.js for all other JavaScipt code.)
