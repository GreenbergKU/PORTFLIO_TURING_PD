<br>__MEMBER__(s): Carly Craft

1. PROJECT OVERVIEW
- This was our FIRST PAIRED PROJECT of Modular 1 in the FE program at Turing.  
- Everything done REMOTELY
- We had been given a quick overview of CSS/HTML, but lessons were predominately JAVASCRIPT with some DOM, and GIT interwoven.
- Objective: build a specific, dynamic, website using Javascript, without directly changing the HTML and CSS (supplied), so changes to the HTML and CSS were allowed if done so by means of the Javascript code.
- Instructions for the website: includes a main page with 4 dynamic options(buttons), form to create their own, a different poster in the current display, a "save" option, and to display the collection all "saved".  From those options, more options were provided, including "show" using the inputs entered in the form, "go back", and "delete" options were to be available without a physical (button) option to do so.  

2. OVERALL
- I will fufill whatever role needs to be filed. 
I can be the peacekeeper, or the leader, but no metter which role, I take pride in consistently fufilling the role as the reliable and competant teammate that other teammates can count on.
- I believe everyone can make a meaningful impact if their strengths are utilized.  
- Carly taught me a 2 valuable lessons: 
    1. is it okay to 'ask for help'
    - it is a valuable tool I should get in the habit of utuilizing more
    - Instead of my misconcienved notion of it being a sign of weakness, she showed me how it is a sign of strength
    - acknowlegde what you don't know and to learn from those who do   
    
    2. how to 'ask for help'
    - I had never posted a 'coding' question on the forums until a few days ago
    - I learned how to set up a call with more than 1 other person
    - most importantly, by doing that for the first time, I realized that others are more than willing to help, and I can go to them without fear of how I would be perceived. 
3. TECHNICAL CHALLENGE
- Biggest challenge: Git, the branch/merge/pull was causing us some problems.  
    - We turned to our MOD1 instructors to help us with the conflicts of the first merge/pull issue
    - We instituted changes to how we implemented the Git system to avoid that kind of issue reoccuring
    - This issue yielded an increase in communication which improved the effieciency of our productivity. 
    - In regards to communication, this taught us the importance of frequency, clarity, and understanding which lay the perfect foundation as we build a structure that supports healthy teamwork practices.
4. REFLECTION
- Personal takeaway: 
    - ASK FOR HELP! Saves time and energy, increases productivity and efficiency, and shouldn't carry a negative sitma!
    - COMMUNICATION is key to building teamwork that yeilds success!
- Technical takeaway:
    - ASK FOR HELP!
    - Be prepared to adapt to situations so issues don't derail a project.
- Focus for next project:
    - Better sense of priorities
    - Inprovement on time management and productive study habbits.
