# Project Reflections

<!-- #2005 -->
Often times in interviews, you will be asked to provide a detailed description of a time you worked in a team. The strongest interviewers are able to provide a detailed account of the project and cite specific examples to highlight wins and/or struggles. At Turing, we want you to being crafting your portfolio of "experiences" so that you can have several examples you can speak to when you are interviewing.

<!-- #2005 instructions: 
Please create a private gist that highlights the prompts below. Take time to provide thoughtful and descriptive answers while the experience is still fresh in your mind so that you have a collection of reflections you can pull from when it is time to start interviewing! 
-->

<!-- #2003
Use this template to keep a log of reflections on each of your projects through Mod 1, 2, 3, and 4 at Turing. Feel free to add additional questions/prompts that you want to reflect on to help you prepare for future interviews.
